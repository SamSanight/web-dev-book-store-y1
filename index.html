                        Shooting stars tear across the night sky, then a gigantic artificial 
                        cylinder descends from Mars to land near London. Inquisitive locals 
                        gather round, only to be struck down by a murderous Heat-Ray. Giant 
                        destructive machines disgorge from the cylinder, destroying everything 
                        in their path on a merciless march towards the capital. Can humanity 
                        survive this Martian onslaught?

                        when a letter arrives, delivered by a shaggy giant of a man called Hagrid, 
                        that Harry learns the truth that will transform his entire future: his 
                        parents were killed by the evil Lord Voldemort, and he, Harry, is a wizard.<br>
                        Whisked away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy, Harry discovers

                        finds that his school has its own dark secrets – and an adventure that will

                    <h5>Stephen King</h5>
                    <p>
                        Danny is only five years old, but in the words of old Mr Hallorann he is a 
                        'shiner', aglow with psychic voltage. When his father becomes caretaker of 
                        the Overlook Hotel, Danny's visions grow out of control. As winter closes 
                        in and blizzards cut them off, the hotel seems to develop a life of its own.
                         It is meant to be empty. So who is the lady in Room 217 and who are the masked 
                         guests going up and down in the elevator? And why do the hedges shaped like animals 
                         seem so alive?

                    <h2>Dune</h2>
                    <h5>by Frank Herbert</h5>
                    <p>
                        Before The Matrix, before Star Wars, before Ender's Game and Neuromancer, 
                        there was Dune – widely considered one of the greatest sci-fi novels ever 
                        written. Melange, or 'spice', is the most valuable - and rarest - element 
                        in the universe. And it can only be found on a single planet: the inhospitable
                        desert world Arrakis. Whoever controls Arrakis controls the spice. And whoever
                        controls the spice controls the universe. Against this backdrop, man as a political
                        animal is laid completely bare and pertinent themes are explored, making Dune one
                        of the epic sci-fi novels of the twentieth century.
